    """An account is one fund in a bank.

    In reality, banks don't keep everyone's money separate, they just put all
    the money together and keep track of how much belongs to each account.
    Banks don't even keep enough money around to pay out everyone's accounts.
    They loan out your money to others for a profit and just keep enough for
    the amount they expect people to withdraw. In the past, there have been
    times when something scary happened and everybody wanted to take their
    money out at once and there wasn't enough. This is called a
    "run on the bank."

            >>> from account import Account
            >>> my_money = Account("Piggy bank")
